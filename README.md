# Architects

Architects is a tool for writing better documentation.

If you are designing client based applications for iOS, Android, or the
Web, and you are heavily reliant on interacting with REST APIs then this
tool will make your life much easier.

### Status

This project is heavily alpha right now.

It is dependent on rspec_api_documentation configured to output its
specs in JSON mode.
